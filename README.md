### IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

* Controllers contain functions that are called by view, they perform queries through the models
* Variable names should be standard, let's use the python standard notation like: "variable_name" where variables are explanatory and clean, rather a bit longer than unrdble lk ths
* if anyone has to add functions please tell the team because maybe that functionality is already implemented somewhere else
* controllers should stay skinny
